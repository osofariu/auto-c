Add instructions for building and running this program

In the meantime:
- get this working with separate src and build directory
- ideally put object files in obj directory
- make sure we can create a distribution

INSTRUCTIONS for getting the project built and run:

git clone https://github.com/osofariu/auto-c.git
aclocal
autoconf
automake --add-missing
./configure
make
cd bin
./types
